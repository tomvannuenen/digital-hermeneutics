    "Python is the name of a programming language created by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) in the early 1990s, and it is one of many, many programming languages available. Python is a very robust and very popular language, which is why we have chosen to learn it on our course. There are lots of ways that python can be run, the way we have chosen to run python is using *Jupyter Notebooks*, which provide a useable web interface, and allow you to combine text (like this) with code (like the `Hello, World!` program above) very neatly and clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every cell has to be <i class=\"fa-step-forward fa\"></i> `Run` to work. For more complex programs, it will be important to run the cells in the right order, too (i.e., run the cell at the top first, then the next one down etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also insert cells using the `Insert` menu, and move them up and down relative to one another using the <i class=\"fa-arrow-up fa\"></i> and <i class=\"fa-arrow-down fa\"></i> buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Jupyter notebooks run on what's called a Kernel. Sometimes this kernel breaks or stops functioning. In such cases, you'll want to Restart it. Do this by clicking the `Kernel` menu and clicking the `Restart` button.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also find that a lot of cells have comments in them. A comment is a note we leave for ourselves when writing code, explaining what we're thinking or doing. Python ignores these comments entirely, so we can write in human languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "A comment is anything that starts with the hash (`#`) symbol, a comment can take up an entire line, or just the rest of a line containing code. See the two comments below."

If that number is 0, there are no eggs, if it's 1 or more, then there are eggs.\n",
