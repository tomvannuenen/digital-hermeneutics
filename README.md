## About this repo

This repo contains a number of notebooks for the Digital Hermeneutics course at the 2021 DH Summer Minor at UC Berkeley.


## Course Description

This course investigates the possibilities and pitfalls of hermeneutics in the context of datafied society. Based on a historical overview of hermeneutics, it asks: how can we critically assess the algorithmically driven and often controversial claims to knowledge to be found online? Using text analytics, we will analyze how knowledge and ideas are created and negotiated on social media platforms such as Reddit. In doing so, we will build skills in both natural language processing and close reading, in order to push back against problems of filter bubbles, post-truths, and alternative facts.
